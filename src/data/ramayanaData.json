King Dasharatha of Ayodhya, longing for sons, performs the Putrakameshti Yajna. From the sacred fire emerges divine payasam (pudding) that his three queens consume, leading to the birth of four princes: Rama to Kausalya, Bharata to Kaikeyi, and twins Lakshmana and Shatrughna to Sumitra.",

        "In the prosperous kingdom of Kosala lay the magnificent city of Ayodhya, ruled by the righteous King Dasharatha of the Solar dynasty. Though blessed with wealth, power, and the love of his people, the king's heart remained heavy, for he had no heir to continue his noble lineage.",
        "Acting on the counsel of his wise ministers and the sage Vashishta, Dasharatha performed the Ashwamedha Yajna followed by the Putrakameshti Yajna, a sacred ritual for obtaining sons. The devas, pleased by his devotion, sent the god of fire Agni with a golden vessel containing divine payasam.",
        "Dasharatha distributed this sacred pudding among his three queens. Queen Kausalya received half, Queen Sumitra received a quarter, and Queen Kaikeyi received the remaining quarter. In due course, Kausalya gave birth to Rama, Kaikeyi to Bharata, and Sumitra to the twins Lakshmana and Shatrughna.",
        "The princes grew up learning the arts of warfare, governance, and Vedic knowledge under the guidance of sage Vashishta. Rama and Lakshmana developed an inseparable bond, as did Bharata and Shatrughna.",
        "When Rama was sixteen, the great sage Vishwamitra arrived at Ayodhya seeking help. Demons Maricha and Subahu were disrupting his sacred rituals. Though heartbroken at the thought of sending his young sons to battle demons, Dasharatha, bound by dharma, allowed Rama and Lakshmana to accompany the sage.",
        "Under Vishwamitra's tutelage, Rama received divine weapons and mantras. He destroyed the demoness Tataka and protected the sage's yajna by vanquishing Maricha and Subahu. The sage then led them to Mithila, the kingdom of the wise King Janaka.",
        "In Mithila stood the divine bow of Lord Shiva, which no mortal could even move. King Janaka had declared that whoever could string this bow would marry his daughter Sita, herself found miraculously in a furrow while the king was ploughing a field for a yajna.",
        "With effortless grace, Rama not only lifted the mighty bow but broke it while attempting to string it. The sound reverberated across the three worlds. Sita, watching with bated breath, placed the wedding garland around Rama's neck. The divine couple was married with great celebration, and Rama's brothers were also wed to Sita's sister and cousins."

        "However, fate had other plans. Manthara, the hunchbacked maid of Queen Kaikeyi, poisoned her mistress's mind with jealousy and fear. She convinced Kaikeyi that Rama's coronation would reduce Bharata's status and that Kaikeyi herself would become a mere servant to Queen Kausalya.",
        "Overcome by misguided maternal instinct, Kaikeyi entered the sulking chamber and demanded that Dasharatha fulfill two boons he had promised her long ago on the battlefield when she saved his life. With a heavy heart, she demanded that Bharata be crowned king and Rama be exiled to the Dandaka forest for fourteen years.",
        "Dasharatha was shattered. He pleaded, begged, and offered his kingdom, his life, anything but this cruel demand. But Kaikeyi remained unmoved, citing his duty to honor his word. The king, bound by his promise and the sacred vow of a Kshatriya, had no choice but to comply.",
        "When Rama learned of the decree, he accepted it with complete equanimity. Without a trace of anger or disappointment, he prepared to leave for the forest. His only concern was for his aged father's well-being and his people's sorrow.",
        "Sita, the embodiment of wifely devotion, insisted on accompanying Rama. 'A wife's place is beside her husband,' she declared. 'The forest with you is heaven; a palace without you is hell.' Lakshmana too refused to stay behind, choosing to serve his brother in the wilderness.",
        "The departure from Ayodhya was heart-wrenching. Citizens wept openly, many following the chariot until exhaustion overcame them. Dasharatha collapsed repeatedly, calling out for his beloved son. The city that had prepared for a celebration now drowned in grief.",
        "Unable to bear the separation, King Dasharatha died of a broken heart, calling out Rama's name with his last breath. Meanwhile, Bharata, who was away at his maternal grandfather's home, returned to find his father dead and his beloved brother exiled—all because of his own mother's treachery.",
        "Enraged and heartbroken, Bharata renounced his mother and set out for the forest to bring Rama back. At Chitrakoot, he fell at Rama's feet, begging him to return. But Rama gently refused, explaining that fulfilling their father's word was their highest duty.",
        "Accepting Rama's decision but refusing to rule in his own name, Bharata requested Rama's sandals. He placed these sacred paduka on the throne of Ayodhya and ruled as regent for fourteen years, living as an ascetic at Nandigram, awaiting his brother's return."

        "In a fit of jealous rage, Shurpanakha attempted to attack Sita. Swift as lightning, Lakshmana drew his sword and cut off her nose and ears. Howling in pain and humiliation, she fled to her brothers Khara and Dushana, demon commanders who ruled portions of the forest.",

        "The Vanara army, millions strong, marched to the southern shore. Rama faced the impossible task of crossing the ocean with his army. He meditated on the ocean god, and when no response came, raised his bow in divine wrath.",
        "The Ocean, appearing before Rama, explained that his nature prevented him from parting. However, Nala the Vanara architect could build a bridge, and the ocean would support it. With magical engineering, the Vanara army built a bridge of floating stones.",
        "Meanwhile, Vibhishana, Ravana's righteous brother, could no longer support adharma. After his counsel was rejected, he defected to Rama with four followers. Though the Vanaras were suspicious, Rama accepted him, declaring that one who seeks refuge must never be turned away.",
        "The army crossed and laid siege to Lanka. Ravana sent his warriors one by one, and one by one they fell. Indrajit, Ravana's son, was the most formidable—he rendered Rama and Lakshmana unconscious with the Nagastra.",
        "Hanuman flew to the Himalayas for the life-giving Sanjeevani herb. Unable to identify the herb, he brought the entire mountain, and the brothers were revived. The war continued with terrible ferocity.",
        "Lakshmana killed Indrajit after a fierce battle. Kumbhakarna, Ravana's giant brother who slept for months, was awakened and killed after devastating the Vanara army. One by one, Ravana's champions fell.",
        "Finally, Ravana himself entered the battlefield. The gods sent their own chariot for Rama. The two warriors fought for days. Rama's arrows struck off Ravana's heads, but new ones grew. Finally, Rama used the Brahmastra, charged with mantras, which pierced Ravana's heart.",
        "The ten-headed king fell, and even the gods mourned, for despite his sins, Ravana had been a great scholar and devotee. Vibhishana was crowned king of Lanka.",
        "Sita was brought before Rama, but the reunion was bitter. To prove her purity after months in Ravana's custody, Sita entered fire. Agni, the fire god, returned her unharmed, declaring her pure. The gods appeared and revealed Rama's divine nature."

        "However, whispers spread among the citizens questioning Sita's purity after living in Ravana's kingdom. Though Rama knew Sita was pure, as king, he felt bound to maintain his subjects' faith in the royal house.",
        "With agonizing reluctance, Rama asked Lakshmana to take Sita, now pregnant, to the forest near Valmiki's ashram and leave her there. Lakshmana, heartbroken, obeyed. Sita, abandoned but not broken, found refuge with the sage Valmiki.",
        "In the ashram, Sita gave birth to twin sons, Lava and Kusha. Valmiki taught them the Ramayana, his composition, and they became accomplished warriors and singers. They did not know their own origin.",
        "Years later, Rama performed the Ashwamedha Yajna. The sacrificial horse wandered into Valmiki's ashram, where Lava and Kusha captured it. When Rama's army came, the twins defeated every warrior including Lakshmana, Bharata, and Shatrughna, not knowing they were fighting their own family.",
        "Valmiki brought the twins to Rama's court where they sang the Ramayana. Rama recognized them as his sons and summoned Sita. He asked her to prove her purity before the assembly.",
        "Sita, weary of proving herself repeatedly, called upon her mother Earth. 'If I have been faithful only to Rama,' she declared, 'let the earth receive me.' The ground split open, and a divine throne rose. Bhudevi, the Earth goddess, took her daughter Sita onto her lap and descended into the earth.",
        "Rama was inconsolable. He ruled for many more years but never remarried, keeping a golden image of Sita beside him. Eventually, he performed the final sacrifice of entering the Sarayu River, returning to his divine abode as Vishnu."
